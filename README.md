### Week1 plan: 
1. read MobileNet paper and try to understand why it's more efficient than some of previous small models. 
2. review and learn how to use PyTorch by reading the book ["deep learning with pytorch"](books/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf)
### Week1 summay:
Read about MobileNetV1 and V2. Know about depthwise separable convolution, get stuck at MobileNetV2.\
As its title, it uses linear bottleneck architecture and inverted residual to improve MobileNetV1.\
Read a little about bottleneck from ResNet paper.\
Start from attention is all you need paper to learn about transformer

### Week2 plan:
1. learn deeper about MobileNet
2. read more about transformer and ViT
